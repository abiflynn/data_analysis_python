**Data-Driven Businesses with Python, Pandas and Matplotlib**

**1. Project Objectives & Overview**

**1.1. Business Problem**

Eniac is an online marketplace specialising in Apple-compatible accessories. It was founded 10 years ago in Spain, and it has since grown and expanded.

Working as a data analyst, I analysed the data to help resolve the ongoing debate on whether or not it’s beneficial to discount products.

- The Marketing Team Lead is convinced that offering discounts is beneficial in the long run. She believes discounts improve customer acquisition, satisfaction and retention, and allow the company to grow.

- The main investors in the Board are worried about offering aggressive discounts. They have pointed out how the company’s recent quarterly results showed an increase in orders placed, but a decrease in the total revenue. They prefer that the company positions itself in the quality segment, rather than competing to offer the lowest prices in the market.
